        <h2>IN NEED OF A DEVELOPER?</h2>
        
        <p>I'm not engaged in any presssing peojects at the moment. I'm available for short projects
        but will always give long-term and full-time employment preference. I like being part of
        a team that develops applications for use by millions of people; I find it more rewarding knowing
        that my skills contributed to improving our way of life.</p>
        
        <p>If youâ€™re looking to create a minimum viable product or want to test the waters with a new
        idea or concept, then get in touch. I can help create a product to seek funding, prove a concept
        or just seek market feedback. As an enterpreneur with various applications in the market, I'm always
        looking to collaborate with like-minded creators and developers. If you have an idea that you believe
        can change the world, and have clear goals and a water-tight plan to implement it then just write me an email</p>
