                    <p>My name is Dennis Macharia Nthiga,
                    and I'm a full stack Javascript developer from Kenya. I started coding while
                    still in school and fell in love with it more after graduating from
                    Jomo Kenyatta University of Technology and Agriculture in 2012. Nowadays,
                    I code as a career but MAINLY because it's fun.

                        <p id="idn">While I have a strong Computer Science background having studied BBIT (Bachelor of Business Information Technology), I like to think of myself as
                        a self-taught developer â€” Well, the reason is quite simple. I spent a lot of time learning coding on my own. Coding is something I enjoy and
                        would do for free (but money makes most things better). I have done projects in most of the popular languages (and stacks) including
                        C#, Java, PHP, JS, C++, Python, Ruby/Rails, JavaScript, and C, to name but a few. <br> Ultimately, I've come to love Javascript mainly because
                        of nodeJS, its flexibility and performance. Nonetheless, I find all languages fun and I'm always ready for the next challenge. Currently, 
                        I'm learning GoLang and hope to transition to using it fully within the next few projects</p>
